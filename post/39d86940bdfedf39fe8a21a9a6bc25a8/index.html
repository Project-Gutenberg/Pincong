When these processes loose integration such as cancer, then uncontrolled cell growth occurs. Cancer of the oesophagus ranks as the ninth most common malignancy in the world, and recent evidence shows that its incidence is increasing.

Once the tumor is stable, it can then invade neighbouring cells leading to metastasis. In esophageal cancer cells the increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) stimulates endothelial proliferation and migration. Increased expression of VEGFs and VEGFRs (receptors) were detected in metaplastic tissues of the lower esophagus but not in normal esophageal epithelium, indicating sustained neovascular development early in Barrett’s carcinogenesis</p><p>【Dlamini文章】　　Angiogenesis　　Angiogenesis is the development of new blood vessels, which provide blood and nutrient supply to tumours to survive.

The cell–cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) hold cells together, and believed to play an important role in metastasis of the cancer cell. h-Catenin has been found to play a role in squamous esophageal cancer cells, by its cell–cell adhesion ****function and interactions with the cytoskeleton and cadherin junctions of cells. h-Catenin has been implicated in the transcription of oncogenes such as c-myc, c-jun and cyclin D1, which are oncogenes frequently active in esophageal cancer cells. The APC gene product targets h-catenin for degradation and prevents h-catenin dependent degradation. Increased h-catenin dependent transcription due to hcatenin binding to Fz receptors, mutations in h-catenin, APC, and increased h-catenin expression due to Fz receptor mutations, have all been found in adenocarcinomas and squamous esophageal carcinomas. It is therefore believed that down-regulation of hcatenin expression by antisense technology could be an effective treatment for esophageal cancer.</p><p>【Dlamini文章】　　Invasion and metastasis　　Invasion and metastasis of oesophageal cancer is poorly understood.
